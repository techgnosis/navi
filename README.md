Remembering long shell commands is difficult. There are a variety of methods for remembering, all of which fall short. For example:
* Writing the commands down
* Shell aliases
* Shell functions

Writing the commands down requires you to not only find where you wrote the command you need, but to then copy and paste that command. It's not a terrible setup but it has the same problem of relying on human memory, as well as being tedious.

Shell aliases are essentially repeating the same problem of remembering long shell commands. If you make an alias for each shell command then you have to now remember the aliases that you made. This is a non-starter. 

Shell functions have the exact same problem as the aliases, in that you have to remember the functions.

`navi` solves this problem by allowing you to store all your commands in "cheat files" and then providing string-matching functionality so you don't have to remember the exact command. You can type some of the command and you usually find it quickly. You can then execute the command right away. With `navi` you can capture incredible amounts of tedious work in cheat files and level-up your shell usage almost immediately.
